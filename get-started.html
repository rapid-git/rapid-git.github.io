  <p>
    rapid-git provides shortcuts for often-used git commands which aim to make your daily git use more efficient by typing less.
  </p>
  <p>
    rapid-git enables you to interact with files and branches using numbers (called indexes). Indexes represent the files that <code>git status</code> or branches that <code>git branch</code> prints on the screen. When interacting with files you may define ranges using the <a href="/fundamentals">numbers and dots notation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept behind rapid-git was introduced by <a href="https://github.com/agross">Alexander Gro√ü</a> in his repository <a href="https://github.com/agross/git_shizzle">git_shizzle</a>. In contrast to this repository, which uses shell, he implemented his project using Ruby. If you are interested, please have a look at his project too.

  <p>
    There are a few prerequisites worth mentioning:
  </p>

  {% capture prerequisites_1 %}
    <p>
      If you use <strong>bash</strong>, then your bash version needs to be at least v4.0.0. Use the following command to verify it:
    </p>
    <code class="panel">
      bash --version
    </code>
  {% endcapture %}

  {% capture prerequisites_2 %}
    <p>
      If you use <strong>zsh</strong>, then be aware, that we tested the script with v5.0.2 and v5.1.1. Check yours using this command:
    </p>
    <code class="panel">
      zsh --version
    </code>
  {% endcapture %}

  {% capture prerequisites_3 %}
    <p>
      If you use <strong>Mac</strong>, make sure, that you have <strong>gnu-sed</strong> installed. The easiest way is to use <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to install it:
    </p>
    <code class="panel">
      brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names
    </code>
    <p>
      For more extensive instructions on how to install GNU commmand line tools on <strong>Mac</strong>, please refer to this <a href="https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/">blog post</a>.
    </p>
  {% endcapture %}

  {% include unordered-list.html
    type   = 'square steps'
    item-1 = prerequisites_1
    item-2 = prerequisites_2
    item-3 = prerequisites_3
  %}
  <p>
    Let's install rapid-git:
  </p>
  {% capture installation_step-1 %}
    <p>
      Start with cloning this repository:
    </p>
    <code class="panel">
      git clone https://github.com/rapid-git/rapid-git.git
    </code>
  {% endcapture %}

  {% capture installation_step-2 %}
    <p>
      Add <em>rapid-git.sh</em> to <em>.bashrc</em> or <em>.zshrc</em>:
    </p>
    <code class="subtle panel">
      source path/to/rapid-git.sh
    </code>
    {% include panel.html
      type    = 'info'
      title   = 'Note for Windows users:'
      content = 'There is a certain trick for Windows users, who wish to create files such as <em>.bashrc</em> via the Windows Explorer. When typing the file name, do it as follows without defining a file extension: <code>.bashrc.</code>'
    %}
  {% endcapture %}

  {% capture installation_step-3 %}
    <p>
      At this point rapid-git should already work, but you may also add
    </p>
    <code class="subtle panel">
      source path/to/alias.rapid-git.sh
    </code>
    <p>
      to get some default aliases.
    </p>
  {% endcapture %}

  {% include ordered-list.html
    type   = 'steps'
    item-1 = installation_step-1
    item-2 = installation_step-2
    item-3 = installation_step-3
  %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include box.html
  type            = 'opening rhomboid'

  type            = 'closing rhomboid'
